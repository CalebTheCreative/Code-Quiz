# Code-Quiz

This week's assignment was to create a functioning quiz. The quiz is to include a timer and a score that saves locally.

## Installation

1) Create a starting page letting the user know about the quiz and to press the start button to begin the quiz.

2) The user will then answer a series of questions while a timer counts down. For every incorrect answer, the timer will lose ten seconds. A running total of their score will be presented as well.

3) Once the user completes all of the questions or the timer reaches zero, they will be shown their score and asked to input their initials, which will save to the high score list. They can choose to clear scores as well.
